In this file we were asked to refactor the code adding semantic tags, comment correctly the code and removing unnecesary lines in html and css.
Also to improve the overall structure of the webpage.

In my project I added as comments description for each section and also some changes in the code I've made.

##HTML:
-I added comments to describe each section
-I changed all the div tags for semantic tags and gave a little bit of structure.
Header, Nav, Sections, Aside, Footer.
-Fixed the anchor to the first content section (Search engine optimization)
-Added alt attributes to all images and links in the webpage.
